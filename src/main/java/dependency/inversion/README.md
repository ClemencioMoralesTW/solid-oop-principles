# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

* Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
    * High level modules should not depend upon low level modules. Instead they should depend upon abstractions.
      *  *High level code* isnâ€™t concerned with the specific details.
    * Low level modules too should depend upon abstractions.
      * *Low level code* is more concerned with details and specifics.
* All of this allows for decoupling.
* _Not the same as dependency injection!_
