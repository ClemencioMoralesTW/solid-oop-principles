# Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

* A client should not be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use.
* Separate fat interfaces into smaller interfaces.
* If you're breaking this, you may also be breaking SRP.

## Exercise
You are given an "Animal" interface, which is implemented by a lot of different classes. Your goal is to refactor it, respecting the interface segregation principle. Remember TDD!
